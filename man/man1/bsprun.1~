.TH "bsprun" 1 "1.4 25/9/98" "Oxford BSP Toolset" 
.SH NAME
bsprun \- Initiates the parallel execution of a BSP job.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bsprun\c
[ -v ] [ -npes number ]\c
[ -local ]\c
[ -nolocal]\c
[ -noload]\c
[ -splitio ]\c
.I " program command-line-options"

.SH DESCRIPTION
The purpose of this command is to hide the machine specifics of
starting parallel jobs. The programmer specifies with the
.I \-npes
option an 
.I "upper bound" 
of the number of parallel processes to be spawned by a program. This
value doesn not override the value specified by 
.I bsp_begin(3)\c
\&.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-v
Print (on standard error output) the phases involved in the execution
of the command.
.TP
.B \-help
Print this manual page on standard output.
.TP
.B \-local
In the TCP/IP implementation of the library, this option enforces
process zero to be on the processor that initiates the computation.

.TP
.B \-nolocal
In the TCP/IP implementation of the library, this option enforces
process zero to be on a processor other than the one that initiates
the computation.

.TP
.B \-noload
In the TCP/IP implementation of the library, the load daemon will not
be used to determine which processors should be spawned. Processors
will be tried in the order specified by the ~/.bsptcphosts file.

.TP
.B \-npes number
Spawn at most
.I number
BSP processes in parallel. If there are 
.I P 
physical parallel processes available, and 
.I p
processes are spawned by 
.I bsp_begin(3)\c
\&, then the 
.I p 
processes are allocated among the 
.I P 
processors evenly (where 
.I "1<=p<=number"\c
\&).
.TP
.B \-splitio
This option is intended to help the user determine which process
printed data to either standard out or error. A banner of the form:

.nf
--- pine.comlab.ox.ac.uk BSP pid 2 - stdout ---
.fi

will be printed whenever the source pid or stream changes. Note, this
option is only available on some platforms. 

.SH "NOTES"
The environment variable
.I BSP_PROCS
can be used in preference to the option
.I -npes.
