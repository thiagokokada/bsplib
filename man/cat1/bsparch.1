NAME
     bsparch - determine the machine architecture and  communica-
     tion device.


SYNOPSIS
     bsparch [ -arch ] [ -device ] [ -nodefault ] [ -name ]  [  -
     defdevice  machine ] [ -convertname machine ] [ -convertdev-
     ice device ] [ -allarch ] [ -alldevice ] [ -help ]


DESCRIPTION
     bsparch determines the machine specific installation options
     required  to  install  the  Oxford BSP toolset.  Two factors
     guide the installation  of  the  toolset:  (1)  the  machine
     architecture  and operating system release; and (2) the type
     of device used as the communication medium. The -_a_r_c_h option
     determines  the  machine  architecture,  and   - _d_e_v_i_c_e  the
     relevant communication device.

     To date, the tested architectures are:

     SGICHALL64  Silicon Graphics Power Challenge (Irix 6.x)
     SGIORIGIN       Silicon Graphics Origin 2000 (Irix 6.x)
     SGI         Silicon Graphics workstation (Irix 5.x)
     SP2         IBM SP2 running AIX
     CRAYT3E     Cray T3E
     CRAYT3D     Cray T3D
     PARSYTEC    Parsytec Explorer
     CONVEXSPP   Convex SPP
     SunOS       SunOS 4.1.x
     Solaris     SunOS 5.x
     LINUX       PC based Unix
     OSF1        Digital's alpha boxes
     HITACHIMPP  Hitachi SR2001


     The tested communication devices are shown below.  It should
     be  noted,  that only a small subset of the cross-product of
     architectures and devices are valid builds of the toolset.

     SHMEM_SYSV     System V shared memory
     SHMEM_SGI      SGI specific shared memory operations
     MPASS_TCPIP     TCP/IP based message passing
     MPASS_MPI      MPI
     MPASS_MPL      IBM's message passing system
     MPASS_PARIX    Message passing on the Parsytec GC
     MPASS_EXPRESS  Express (Parasoft Ltd) message passing
     DRMA_SHMEM     Cray Shmem one-sided communications

     The default device behaviour of _b_s_p_a_r_c_h(_1) can be overridden
     by  providing  an  environment  variable  _B_S_P__D_E_V_I_C_E  in the

     user's environment, whose value is the name of  the  desired
     device. You will have to override the default behaviour when
     installing bsplib(3) on top of MPI.
