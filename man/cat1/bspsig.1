NAME
     bspsig - Generate a signature from a BSP profile


SYNOPSIS
     bspsig [-v] [-help] [-wfm] [-sig]  [-stat]  [-sort  _k_e_y]  [-
     bucket  _s_i_z_e]  [-compress  _s_i_z_e]  [-ignore _p_e_r_c_e_n_t_a_g_e] [-slg
     _b_s_p-_p_a_r_a_m_e_t_e_r_s] _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e


DESCRIPTION
     Generate a profile and cost signature  for  the  trace  file
     _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e.  Trace  files are generated by adding the option -
     _p_r_o_f when compiling BSPlib programs with bspfront(1).


OPTIONS
     -v    Print (on standard error output) the  phases  involved
          in  the  execution  of  the  profiler.  The option also
          prints the version number of the profiler.

     -help
          Print this manual page on standard output.

     -bucket _s_i_z_e
          The profiler generates  an  entry  for  each  different
          sized  h-relation  generated by the same textual super-
          step. The -_b_u_c_k_e_t option, combines h-relations from the
          same superstep that are _s_i_z_e apart.

     -compress _s_i_z_e
          This option repeatedly compresses the size of the  pro-
          file until at most _s_i_z_e entries remain.

     -ignore _p_e_r_c_e_n_t
          Ignore all cost centres for which both the  computation
          and  communication account for less then _p_e_r_c_e_n_t of the
          total cost.

     -_w_f_m  Use an alternative format for displaying the output.

     -_s_i_g  Similar to - _w_f_m  except  entries  with  the  same  h-
          relation  size  are  merged.  Use an alternative format
          for displaying the output.


     -_s_t_a_t
          Prints the following accumulated h-relation statistics:

          _M_a_x _s_u_p_e_r_s_t_e_p_s
               the normal BSP interpretation of h-relation cost;

          _M_a_x _a_s_y_n_c
               costs the comunication as though the  program  was
               running with no superstep structure;

          _V_o_l_u_m_e
               costs average h-relation size in each superstep;

          _M_i_n _a_s_y_n_c
               minimum total communication by any processor;

          _M_i_n _s_u_p_e_r_s_t_e_p_s
               costs mimimum h-relation size in each superstep.


     -slg _s,_l,_g[,_n_h_a_l_f]
          When generating the profile, the options to  - _s_l_g  are
          numbers which represent the BSP parameters:

          _s    is the _M_e_g_a_f_l_o_p/_s rating for the machine.

          _l    the minimum number of flops  for  a  barrier  syn-
               chronisation.

          _g    the asymptotic number of flops  required  for  all
               processors  to  communicate a single 32bit word to
               another process.

          _n_h_a_l_f
               the number of words required for the communication
               performance to deteriorate to 2g.
     See _b_s_p_p_a_r_a_m(_1) for information concerning the BSP parameter
     database.

     -sort _k_e_y
          The profile is sorted using _k_e_y; where _k_e_y is one of:

          _c_o_m_m_t_h_e_o_r_y
               Theoretical communication cost  [default].

          _h_r_e_l Size of h-relation.

          _s_y_n_c_s
               The number of times  a  particular  superstep  was
               executed.

          _c_o_m_m_r_e_a_l
               The actual communication cost.

          _d_e_l_t_a
               The difference between the theoretical and  actual
               communication costs.
