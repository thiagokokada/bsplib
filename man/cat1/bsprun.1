bsprun(1)                 User Commands                 bsprun(1)



NAME
     bsprun - Initiates the parallel execution of a BSP job.


SYNOPSIS
     bsprun[  -v  ]  [  -npes  number  ][  -local  ][  -nolocal][
     -noload][ -splitio ] _p_r_o_g_r_a_m _c_o_m_m_a_n_d-_l_i_n_e-_o_p_t_i_o_n_s


DESCRIPTION
     The purpose of this command is to hide the machine specifics
     of starting parallel jobs. The programmer specifies with the
     -_n_p_e_s option an  _u_p_p_e_r  _b_o_u_n_d  of  the  number  of  parallel
     processes  to  be spawned by a program. This value doesn not
     override the value specified by _b_s_p__b_e_g_i_n(_3).


OPTIONS
     -v    Print (on standard error output) the  phases  involved
          in the execution of the command.

     -help
          Print this manual page on standard output.

     -local
          In the  TCP/IP  implementation  of  the  library,  this
          option  enforces  process  zero  to be on the processor
          that initiates the computation.


     -nolocal
          In the  TCP/IP  implementation  of  the  library,  this
          option enforces process zero to be on a processor other
          than the one that initiates the computation.


     -noload
          In the TCP/IP implementation of the library,  the  load
          daemon  will  not be used to determine which processors
          should be spawned. Processors  will  be  tried  in  the
          order specified by the ~/.bsptcphosts file.


     -npes number
          Spawn at most _n_u_m_b_e_r  BSP  processes  in  parallel.  If
          there  are _P physical parallel processes available, and
          _p processes are spawned by  _b_s_p__b_e_g_i_n(_3),  then  the  _p
          processes  are  allocated among the _P processors evenly
          (where _1<=_p<=_n_u_m_b_e_r ).

     -splitio
          This option is intended  to  help  the  user  determine

          which  process  printed  data to either standard out or
          error. A banner of the form:

          --- pine.comlab.ox.ac.uk BSP pid 2 - stdout ---

          will be printed  whenever  the  source  pid  or  stream
          changes.  Note,  this  option is only available on some
          platforms.


NOTES
     The environment variable _B_S_P__P_R_O_C_S can be used in preference
     to the option -_n_p_e_s.
