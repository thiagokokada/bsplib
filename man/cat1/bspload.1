NAME
     bspload - BSP load manager


SYNOPSIS
     bspload [-v] [-help] [-u] [ -all ] [-start] [- end]-s  _h_o_s_t_-
     _n_a_m_e  -r _h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e -p _p_o_r_t-_n_u_m_b_e_r [-reloadlocal] [-reloadglo-
     bal]

DESCRIPTION
     The daemon _b_s_p_l_o_a_d_d is used to  ensure  that  BSP  jobs  are
     started  on the least loaded nodes in a network. A daemon is
     started on a node  of  a  cluster  by  running  the  command
     _b_s_p_l_o_a_d  -_s_t_a_r_t.  The  load of a cluster of workstations can
     then be enquired by the user as follows:

     pine.comlab> bspload

             ***Next update in 9 secs from ash.comlab***

     Priority|    Machine     | CPUs |    Flop rate    | Load |        Age
     --------+----------------+------+-----------------+------+--------------
      1.0000 |     ash.comlab |    2 |   41.29 Mflop/s | 0.04 |        23 sec
      0.3555 |    pine.comlab |    1 |   29.36 Mflop/s | 0.04 |         0 sec
      0.3507 |     oak.comlab |    1 |   28.96 Mflop/s | 0.04 |  3 min 15 sec
      0.0151 | mercury.comlab |    4 |   20.13 Mflop/s | 2.59 |        23 sec

     When a BSP job requests _p  processes,  the  _p  least  loaded
     machines  are  chosen  automatically, which provides a crude
     load balancing facility at process startup time. In the next
     release  of the library, a general purpose process migration
     and checkpoint facility will be provided that  enables  run-
     time load balancing and fault tolerance of bsplib(3) jobs.



OPTIONS
     -v    Print (on standard error output) the  phases  involved
          in the execution of the command.

     -help
          Print this manual page on standard output.


     -u    The output from the load daemon is an unformated  list
          with an entry per line.


     -all  Changes the meaning of the -_s_t_a_r_t and -_e_n_d options.


     -start

          Start the daemon on the local workstation. If the - _a_l_l
          option  has  already been set, then a daemon is started
          on  each  processor  specified  in  .bsptcphosts.  This
          option requires that the local workstation has an entry
          in the .rhost files on all the machines in the cluster,
          as  it  uses  _r_s_h(_3).  If  _r_s_h is not available on your
          platform, you will have to start the daemons on each of
          the machines individually.


     -end  Close down the daemon on the  local  workstations.  If
          the  -_a_l_l option has already been set, then the daemons
          are stopped on all the workstations.


     -s _h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e
          Connect to the load manager on  processor  _h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e  in
          preference to _l_o_c_a_l_h_o_s_t.


     -r _h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e
          Forces the local load manager to update it's local load
          information with the load information from _h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e.


     -p _p_o_r_t_n_u_m_b_e_r
          Ensure that the load manager listens on port _p_o_r_t_n_u_m_b_e_r
          for incoming requests. The default port it 4445.


     -reloadlocal
          Causes the local load manager to update it's local load
          information with loads from every other machine.


     -reloadglobal
          Causes all the load managers to  exchange  their  local
          load information.
