NAME
     litTotex - Convert a literate file into LaTeX


SYNOPSIS
     litToTex _i_n_p_u_t-_f_i_l_e


DESCRIPTION
     A literate style of programming adopts an  inverse  approach
     to  comments. Everything in a literate file is considered to
     be a comment, unless it is specified as program code. litTo-
     Tex  converts a literate laTeX document into a vanilla LaTeX
     document. The style file _l_i_t._s_t_y  should  be  included  into
     your   document   as  it  contains  the  definition  of  the
     \begin{code} \end{code} environment.


FILES
     The file _R_O_O_T_D_I_R/include/lit.sty contains  the  LaTeX  style
     file  for the literate mode; where _R_O_O_T_D_I_R is usually set in
     the top level Makefile of the BSPlib source.
