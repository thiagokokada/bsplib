.SH DESCRIPTION
These function return the BSP parameters for a machine:
.IP "bsp_s"
is the speed of computation of a process in flop/s (that is number of
floating point operations per second).

.IP "bsp_l"
is the synchronisation latency cost in units of 
.B bsp_s\c
\&. i.e., if  
.I s=1000\c
\&, then each processor of the machine could have performed 1000
floating point operations in the same time as all processors take to
barrier synchronise.

.IP "bsp_g" 
is the asymptotic number of flops/word required for all processors to
simultaneously communicate a message.

.IP "bsp_nhalf"
is the number of words required to be communicated such that the
communication performance deteriorates to 
.I 2g
.PP

In the current implementation of the library, the values for each of
these parameters is read from a database file, and not calculated by
experimentation at runtime.


.SH FILES
The file \fIPREFIX\fR/include/bsp_parameters.ascii contains a table
of the BSP parameters read by these functions; where
.I PREFIX
is the installation prefix set when configuring BSPlib.
