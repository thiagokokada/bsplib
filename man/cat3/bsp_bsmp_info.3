NAME
     bsp_qsize - checks to see how many BSMP packets arrived.


C SYNOPSIS
     #include "bsp.h"

     void  bsp_qsize(int *_p_a_c_k_e_t_s, int *_a_c_c_u_m__n_b_y_t_e_s);

FORTRAN SYNOPSIS
     SUBROUTINE  bspqsize(_p_a_c_k_e_t_s,_a_c_c_u_m__n_b_y_t_e_s)
     INTEGER, intent(OUT) ::_p_a_c_k_e_t_s,accum_nbytes



DESCRIPTION
     The  function  bsp_qsize(3)  is  an  enquiry  function  that
     returns  the  number of messages that were sent to this pro-
     cess in the previous superstep and have not  yet  been  con-
     sumed  by  a  bsp_move(3). Before any message is consumed by
     bsp_move(3), the total  number  of  messages  received  will
     match those sent by any bsp_send(3) operations in the previ-
     ous superstep.  function also returns the  accumulated  size
     of  all the payloads of the unconsumed messages. This opera-
     tion is intended to help the user to allocate  an  appropri-
     ately  sized  data  structure  to hold all the messages that
     were sent to a process during a superstep.

NOTES
     i    bsp_qsize(3) returns the number of messages in the sys-
          tem  queue  at  the  point the operation is called; the
          number   returned   therefore   decreases   after   any
          bsp_move(3) operation.
