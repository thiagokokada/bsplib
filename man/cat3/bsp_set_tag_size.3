bsp_set_tagsize(3)      BSPlib FUNCTIONS       bsp_set_tagsize(3)



NAME
     bsp_set_tagsize - tag size of a BSMP packet.


C SYNOPSIS
     #include "bsp.h"

     void bsp_set_tagsize(int *_t_a_g__b_y_t_e_s);

FORTRAN SYNOPSIS
     SUBROUTINE  bspsettagsize(tag_bytes)
       INTEGER, intent(INOUT) :: _t_a_g__b_y_t_e_s


DESCRIPTION
     Allowing the user to set the tag size  enables  the  use  of
     tags that are appropriate for the communication requirements
     of each superstep.  This should be  particularly  useful  in
     the development of subroutines either in user programs or in
     libraries.

     The procedure must be called collectively by all  processes.
     A  change  in  tag size takes effect in the following super-
     step; it then becomes _v_a_l_i_d.

     The value of _t_a_g__b_y_t_e_s on entry to the procedure,  specifies
     the size of the fixed-length portion of every message in the
     current and succeeding supersteps; the default tag  size  is
     zero.  On return from the procedure, _t_a_g__b_y_t_e_s is changed to
     reflect the previous value of the tag size.

NOTES
     i    The tag size of outgoing messages is prescribed by  the
          tag size that is valid in the current superstep.


     ii   The tag  size  of  messages  in  the  system  queue  is
          prescribed by the tag size that was valid in the previ-
          ous superstep.

     iii  bsp_set_tagsize(3) must be called by _a_l_l processes with
          the  same  argument  in  the  same  superstep.  In this
          respect, it is similar to bsp_push_reg(3).


     iv   bsp_set_tagsize(3) takes effect in the next superstep.



     v    Given a sequence of bsp_set_tagsize(3) within the  same
          superstep,  then the value of the last of these will be
          used as the tag size for the next superstep.


     vi   The default tag size is 0.
