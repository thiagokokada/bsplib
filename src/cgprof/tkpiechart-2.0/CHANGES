*** version 2.0 ***
For Tcl 7.4 and Tk 4.0, also works with Tcl 7.5 and Tk 4.1 a2 (on Windows!).
Pie only composed of canvas items and displayed in a canvas, so printing is easy.
Pie has a canvas tag so it can be moved easily using normal canvas functionality.
Use of new canvasLabel and canvasLabelsArray classes for pie labelling.
Use of switched options in constructors and configuration functions.
One step further in object orientation with virtual functions.
Added optional label placers, such as value next to the corresponding slice.
Removed slice highlighting (may be reintroduced later if there is demand).
Use degrees instead or radians in slice code to simplify and improve performance.
Slices are no longer sized by passing a percent value but a unit share value (between 0 and 1).
The slice label can be updated with an optional user defined value.
Added a crunched file that can be sourced as is.
New simplified and more efficient delete and new implementations, virtual operators added.
